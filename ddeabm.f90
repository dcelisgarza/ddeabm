! * ABSTRACT *
! ************
!
!   Subroutine DDEABM uses the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton
!   Predictor-Corrector formulas of orders one through twelve to
!   integrate a system of NEQ first order ordinary differential
!   equations of the form
!                         DU/DX = DF(X,U)
!   when the vector Y(*) of initial values for U(*) at X=T is given.
!   The subroutine integrates from T to TOUT. It is easy to continue the
!   integration to get results at additional TOUT.  This is the interval
!   mode of operation.  It is also easy for the routine to return with
!   the solution at each intermediate step on the way to TOUT.  This is
!   the intermediate-output mode of operation.
!
!   DDEABM uses subprograms DDES, DSTEPS, DINTP, DHSTRT, DHVNRM,
!   D1MACH, and the error handling routine XERMSG.  The only machine
!   dependent parameters to be assigned appear in D1MACH.
!
! **********************************************************************
! * Description of The Arguments To DDEABM (An Overview) *
! **********************************************************************
!
!   The Parameters are
!
!      DF -- This is the name of a subroutine which you provide to
!             define the differential equations.
!
!      NEQ -- This is the number of (first order) differential
!             equations to be integrated.
!
!      T -- This is a DOUBLE PRECISION value of the independent
!           variable.
!
!      Y(*) -- This DOUBLE PRECISION array contains the solution
!              components at T.
!
!      TOUT -- This is a DOUBLE PRECISION point at which a solution is
!              desired.
!
!      INFO(*) -- The basic task of the code is to integrate the
!             differential equations from T to TOUT and return an
!             answer at TOUT.  INFO(*) is an INTEGER array which is used
!             to communicate exactly how you want this task to be
!             carried out.
!
!      RTOL, ATOL -- These DOUBLE PRECISION quantities represent
!                    relative and absolute error tolerances which you
!                    provide to indicate how accurately you wish the
!                    solution to be computed.  You may choose them to be
!                    both scalars or else both vectors.
!
!      IDID -- This scalar quantity is an indicator reporting what
!             the code did.  You must monitor this INTEGER variable to
!             decide what action to take next.
!
!      RWORK(*), LRW -- RWORK(*) is a DOUBLE PRECISION work array of
!             length LRW which provides the code with needed storage
!             space.
!
!      IWORK(*), LIW -- IWORK(*) is an INTEGER work array of length LIW
!             which provides the code with needed storage space and an
!             across call flag.
!
!      RPAR, IPAR -- These are DOUBLE PRECISION and INTEGER parameter
!             arrays which you can use for communication between your
!             calling program and the DF subroutine.
!
!  Quantities which are used as input items are
!             NEQ, T, Y(*), TOUT, INFO(*),
!             RTOL, ATOL, RWORK(1), LRW and LIW.
!
!  Quantities which may be altered by the code are
!             T, Y(*), INFO(1), RTOL, ATOL,
!             IDID, RWORK(*) and IWORK(*).
!
! **********************************************************************
! * INPUT -- What To Do On The First Call To DDEABM *
! **********************************************************************
!
!   The first call of the code is defined to be the start of each new
!   problem.  Read through the descriptions of all the following items,
!   provide sufficient storage space for designated arrays, set
!   appropriate variables for the initialization of the problem, and
!   give information about how you want the problem to be solved.
!
!
!      DF -- Provide a subroutine of the form
!                               DF(X,U,UPRIME,RPAR,IPAR)
!             to define the system of first order differential equations
!             which is to be solved.  For the given values of X and the
!             vector  U(*)=(U(1),U(2),...,U(NEQ)) , the subroutine must
!             evaluate the NEQ components of the system of differential
!             equations  DU/DX=DF(X,U)  and store the derivatives in the
!             array UPRIME(*), that is,  UPRIME(I) = * DU(I)/DX *  for
!             equations I=1,...,NEQ.
!
!             Subroutine DF must NOT alter X or U(*).  You must declare
!             the name df in an external statement in your program that
!             calls DDEABM.  You must dimension U and UPRIME in DF.
!
!             RPAR and IPAR are DOUBLE PRECISION and INTEGER parameter
!             arrays which you can use for communication between your
!             calling program and subroutine DF. They are not used or
!             altered by DDEABM.  If you do not need RPAR or IPAR,
!             ignore these parameters by treating them as dummy
!             arguments. If you do choose to use them, dimension them in
!             your calling program and in DF as arrays of appropriate
!             length.
!
!      NEQ -- Set it to the number of differential equations.
!             (NEQ >= 1)
!
!      T -- Set it to the initial point of the integration.
!             You must use a program variable for T because the code
!             changes its value.
!
!      Y(*) -- Set this vector to the initial values of the NEQ solution
!             components at the initial point.  You must dimension Y at
!             least NEQ in your calling program.
!
!      TOUT -- Set it to the first point at which a solution
!             is desired.  You can take TOUT = T, in which case the code
!             will evaluate the derivative of the solution at T and
!             return. Integration either forward in T  (TOUT > T)  or
!             backward in T  (TOUT < T)  is permitted.
!
!             The code advances the solution from T to TOUT using
!             step sizes which are automatically selected so as to
!             achieve the desired accuracy.  If you wish, the code will
!             return with the solution and its derivative following
!             each intermediate step (intermediate-output mode) so that
!             you can monitor them, but you still must provide TOUT in
!             accord with the basic aim of the code.
!
!             The first step taken by the code is a critical one
!             because it must reflect how fast the solution changes near
!             the initial point.  The code automatically selects an
!             initial step size which is practically always suitable for
!             the problem. By using the fact that the code will not step
!             past TOUT in the first step, you could, if necessary,
!             restrict the length of the initial step size.
!
!             For some problems it may not be permissible to integrate
!             past a point TSTOP because a discontinuity occurs there
!             or the solution or its derivative is not defined beyond
!             TSTOP.  When you have declared a TSTOP point (see INFO(4)
!             and RWORK(1)), you have told the code not to integrate
!             past TSTOP.  In this case any TOUT beyond TSTOP is invalid
!             input.
!
!      INFO(*) -- Use the INFO array to give the code more details about
!             how you want your problem solved.  This array should be
!             dimensioned of length 15 to accommodate other members of
!             DEPAC or possible future extensions, though DDEABM uses
!             only the first four entries.  You must respond to all of
!             the following items which are arranged as questions.  The
!             simplest use of the code corresponds to answering all
!             questions as YES ,i.e. setting ALL entries of INFO to 0.
!
!        INFO(1) -- This parameter enables the code to initialize
!               itself.  You must set it to indicate the start of every
!               new problem.
!
!            **** Is this the first call for this problem ...
!                  YES -- set INFO(1) = 0
!                   NO -- not applicable here.
!                         See below for continuation calls.  ****
!
!        INFO(2) -- How much accuracy you want of your solution
!               is specified by the error tolerances RTOL and ATOL.
!               The simplest use is to take them both to be scalars.
!               To obtain more flexibility, they can both be vectors.
!               The code must be told your choice.
!
!            **** Are both error tolerances RTOL, ATOL scalars ...
!                  YES -- set INFO(2) = 0
!                         and input scalars for both RTOL and ATOL
!                   NO -- set INFO(2) = 1
!                         and input arrays for both RTOL and ATOL ****
!
!        INFO(3) -- The code integrates from T in the direction
!               of TOUT by steps.  If you wish, it will return the
!               computed solution and derivative at the next
!               intermediate step (the intermediate-output mode) or
!               TOUT, whichever comes first.  This is a good way to
!               proceed if you want to see the behavior of the solution.
!               If you must have solutions at a great many specific
!               TOUT points, this code will compute them efficiently.
!
!            **** Do you want the solution only at
!                 TOUT (and not at the next intermediate step) ...
!                  YES -- set INFO(3) = 0
!                   NO -- set INFO(3) = 1 ****
!
!        INFO(4) -- To handle solutions at a great many specific
!               values TOUT efficiently, this code may integrate past
!               TOUT and interpolate to obtain the result at TOUT.
!               Sometimes it is not possible to integrate beyond some
!               point TSTOP because the equation changes there or it is
!               not defined past TSTOP.  Then you must tell the code
!               not to go past.
!
!            **** Can the integration be carried out without any
!                 Restrictions on the independent variable T ...
!                  YES -- set INFO(4)=0
!                   NO -- set INFO(4)=1
!                         and define the stopping point TSTOP by
!                         setting RWORK(1)=TSTOP ****
!
!      RTOL, ATOL -- You must assign relative (RTOL) and absolute (ATOL)
!             error tolerances to tell the code how accurately you want
!             the solution to be computed.  They must be defined as
!             program variables because the code may change them.  You
!             have two choices --
!                  Both RTOL and ATOL are scalars. (INFO(2)=0)
!                  Both RTOL and ATOL are vectors. (INFO(2)=1)
!             In either case all components must be non-negative.
!
!             The tolerances are used by the code in a local error test
!             at each step which requires roughly that
!                     ABS(LOCAL ERROR) <= RTOL*ABS(Y)+ATOL
!             for each vector component.
!             (More specifically, a Euclidean norm is used to measure
!             the size of vectors, and the error test uses the magnitude
!             of the solution at the beginning of the step.)
!
!             The true (global) error is the difference between the true
!             solution of the initial value problem and the computed
!             approximation.  Practically all present day codes,
!             including this one, control the local error at each step
!             and do not even attempt to control the global error
!             directly.  Roughly speaking, they produce a solution Y(T)
!             which satisfies the differential equations with a
!             residual R(T),    DY(T)/DT = DF(T,Y(T)) + R(T)   ,
!             and, almost always, R(T) is bounded by the error
!             tolerances.  Usually, but not always, the true accuracy of
!             the computed Y is comparable to the error tolerances. This
!             code will usually, but not always, deliver a more accurate
!             solution if you reduce the tolerances and integrate again.
!             By comparing two such solutions you can get a fairly
!             reliable idea of the true error in the solution at the
!             bigger tolerances.
!
!             Setting ATOL=0.D0 results in a pure relative error test on
!             that component. Setting RTOL=0. results in a pure absolute
!             error test on that component.  A mixed test with non-zero
!             RTOL and ATOL corresponds roughly to a relative error
!             test when the solution component is much bigger than ATOL
!             and to an absolute error test when the solution component
!             is smaller than the threshold ATOL.
!
!             Proper selection of the absolute error control parameters
!             ATOL  requires you to have some idea of the scale of the
!             solution components.  To acquire this information may mean
!             that you will have to solve the problem more than once. In
!             the absence of scale information, you should ask for some
!             relative accuracy in all the components (by setting  RTOL
!             values non-zero) and perhaps impose extremely small
!             absolute error tolerances to protect against the danger of
!             a solution component becoming zero.
!
!             The code will not attempt to compute a solution at an
!             accuracy unreasonable for the machine being used.  It will
!             advise you if you ask for too much accuracy and inform
!             you as to the maximum accuracy it believes possible.
!
!      RWORK(*) -- Dimension this DOUBLE PRECISION work array of length
!             LRW in your calling program.
!
!      RWORK(1) -- If you have set INFO(4)=0, you can ignore this
!             optional input parameter.  Otherwise you must define a
!             stopping point TSTOP by setting   RWORK(1) = TSTOP.
!             (for some problems it may not be permissible to integrate
!             past a point TSTOP because a discontinuity occurs there
!             or the solution or its derivative is not defined beyond
!             TSTOP.)
!
!      LRW -- Set it to the declared length of the RWORK array.
!             You must have  LRW >= 130+21*NEQ
!
!      IWORK(*) -- Dimension this INTEGER work array of length LIW in
!             your calling program.
!
!      LIW -- Set it to the declared length of the IWORK array.
!             You must have  LIW >= 51
!
!      RPAR, IPAR -- These are parameter arrays, of DOUBLE PRECISION and
!             INTEGER type, respectively.  You can use them for
!             communication between your program that calls DDEABM and
!             the  DF subroutine.  They are not used or altered by
!             DDEABM.  If you do not need RPAR or IPAR, ignore these
!             parameters by treating them as dummy arguments.  If you do
!             choose to use them, dimension them in your calling program
!             and in DF as arrays of appropriate length.
!
! **********************************************************************
! * OUTPUT -- After Any Return From DDEABM *
! **********************************************************************
!
!   The principal aim of the code is to return a computed solution at
!   TOUT, although it is also possible to obtain intermediate results
!   along the way.  To find out whether the code achieved its goal
!   or if the integration process was interrupted before the task was
!   completed, you must check the IDID parameter.
!
!
!      T -- The solution was successfully advanced to the
!             output value of T.
!
!      Y(*) -- Contains the computed solution approximation at T.
!             You may also be interested in the approximate derivative
!             of the solution at T.  It is contained in
!             RWORK(21),...,RWORK(20+NEQ).
!
!      IDID -- Reports what the code did
!
!                         *** Task Completed ***
!                   Reported by positive values of IDID
!
!             IDID = 1 -- A step was successfully taken in the

!                       completed (T=TOUT) by stepping past TOUT.
!                       Y(*) is obtained by interpolation.

!
!             IDID = -3 -- The local error test cannot be satisfied
!                       because you specified a zero component in ATOL
!                       and the corresponding computed solution
!                       component is zero.  Thus, a pure relative error

!             appropriate for continuing the integration.  However, the
!             reported solution at T was obtained using the input values
!             of RTOL and ATOL.

!      RWORK, IWORK -- Contain information which is usually of no
!             interest to the user but necessary for subsequent calls.
!             However, you may find use for
!
!             RWORK(11)--which contains the step size H to be
!                        attempted on the next step.
!
!             RWORK(12)--if the tolerances have been increased by the
!                        code (IDID = -2) , they were multiplied by the
!                        value in RWORK(12).
!
!             RWORK(13)--Which contains the current value of the
!                        independent variable, i.e. the farthest point
!                        integration has reached. This will be different
!                        from T only when interpolation has been
!                        performed (IDID=3).
!
!             RWORK(20+I)--Which contains the approximate derivative
!                        of the solution component Y(I).  In DDEABM, it
!                        is obtained by calling subroutine DF to
!                        evaluate the differential equation using T and
!                        Y(*) when IDID=1 or 2, and by interpolation
!                        when IDID=3.

! **********************************************************************
! * INPUT -- What To Do To Continue The Integration *
! *             (calls after the first)             *
! **********************************************************************
!
!        This code is organized so that subsequent calls to continue the
!        integration involve little (if any) additional effort on your
!        part. You must monitor the IDID parameter in order to determine
!        what to do next.
!
!        Recalling that the principal task of the code is to integrate
!        from T to TOUT (the interval mode), usually all you will need
!        to do is specify a new TOUT upon reaching the current TOUT.
!
!        Do not alter any quantity not specifically permitted below,
!        in particular do not alter NEQ, T, Y(*), RWORK(*), IWORK(*) or
!        the differential equation in subroutine DF. Any such alteration
!        constitutes a new problem and must be treated as such, i.e.
!        you must start afresh.
!
!        You cannot change from vector to scalar error control or vice
!        versa (INFO(2)) but you can change the size of the entries of
!        RTOL, ATOL.  Increasing a tolerance makes the equation easier
!        to integrate.  Decreasing a tolerance will make the equation
!        harder to integrate and should generally be avoided.
!
!        You can switch from the intermediate-output mode to the
!        interval mode (INFO(3)) or vice versa at any time.
!
!        If it has been necessary to prevent the integration from going
!        past a point TSTOP (INFO(4), RWORK(1)), keep in mind that the
!        code will not integrate to any TOUT beyond the currently
!        specified TSTOP.  Once TSTOP has been reached you must change
!        the value of TSTOP or set INFO(4)=0.  You may change INFO(4)
!        or TSTOP at any time but you must supply the value of TSTOP in
!        RWORK(1) whenever you set INFO(4)=1.
!
!        The parameter INFO(1) is used by the code to indicate the
!        beginning of a new problem and to indicate whether integration
!        is to be continued.  You must input the value  INFO(1) = 0
!        when starting a new problem.  You must input the value
!        INFO(1) = 1  if you wish to continue after an interrupted task.
!        Do not set  INFO(1) = 0  on a continuation call unless you
!        want the code to restart at the current T.
!
!                         *** Following A Completed Task ***
!         If
!             IDID = 1, call the code again to continue the integration
!                     another step in the direction of TOUT.
!
!             IDID = 2 or 3, define a new TOUT and call the code again.
!                     TOUT must be different from T. You cannot change
!                     the direction of integration without restarting.
!
!                         *** Following An Interrupted Task ***
!                     To show the code that you realize the task was
!                     interrupted and that you want to continue, you
!                     must take appropriate action and reset INFO(1) = 1
!         If
!             IDID = -1, the code has attempted 500 steps.
!                     If you want to continue, set INFO(1) = 1 and
!                     call the code again. An additional 500 steps
!                     will be allowed.
!
!             IDID = -2, the error tolerances RTOL, ATOL have been
!                     increased to values the code estimates appropriate
!                     for continuing.  You may want to change them
!                     yourself.  If you are sure you want to continue
!                     with relaxed error tolerances, set INFO(1)=1 and
!                     call the code again.
!
!             IDID = -3, a solution component is zero and you set the
!                     corresponding component of ATOL to zero.  If you
!                     are sure you want to continue, you must first
!                     alter the error criterion to use positive values
!                     for those components of ATOL corresponding to zero
!                     solution components, then set INFO(1)=1 and call
!                     the code again.
!
!             IDID = -4, the problem appears to be stiff.  It is very
!                     inefficient to solve such problems with DDEABM.
!                     The code DDEBDF in DEPAC handles this task
!                     efficiently.  If you are absolutely sure you want
!                     to continue with DDEABM, set INFO(1)=1 and call
!                     the code again.
!
!             IDID = -5,-6,-7,..,-32  --- cannot occur with this code
!                     but used by other members of DEPAC or possible
!                     future extensions.
!
!                         *** Following A Terminated Task ***
!         If
!             IDID = -33, you cannot continue the solution of this
!                     problem.  An attempt to do so will result in your
!                     run being terminated.

!
! ....   You have a choice of three differential equation solvers from
! ....   DEPAC. The following brief descriptions are meant to aid you in
! ....   choosing the most appropriate code for your problem.
!
! ....   DDERKF is a fifth order Runge-Kutta code. It is the simplest of
! ....   the three choices, both algorithmically and in the use of the
! ....   code. DDERKF is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and
! ....   mildly stiff differential equations when derivative evaluations
! ....   are not expensive. It should generally not be used to get high
! ....   accuracy results nor answers at a great many specific points.
! ....   Because DDERKF has very low overhead costs, it will usually
! ....   result in the least expensive integration when solving
! ....   problems requiring a modest amount of accuracy and having
! ....   equations that are not costly to evaluate. DDERKF attempts to
! ....   discover when it is not suitable for the task posed.
!
! ....   DDEABM is a variable order (one through twelve) Adams code.
! ....   Its complexity lies somewhere between that of DDERKF and
! ....   DDEBDF.  DDEABM is primarily designed to solve non-stiff and
! ....   mildly stiff differential equations when derivative evaluations
! ....   are expensive, high accuracy results are needed or answers at
! ....   many specific points are required. DDEABM attempts to discover
! ....   when it is not suitable for the task posed.
!
! ....   DDEBDF is a variable order (one through five) backward
! ....   differentiation formula code. it is the most complicated of
! ....   the three choices. DDEBDF is primarily designed to solve stiff
! ....   differential equations at crude to moderate tolerances.
! ....   If the problem is very stiff at all, DDERKF and DDEABM will be
! ....   quite inefficient compared to DDEBDF. However, DDEBDF will be
! ....   inefficient compared to DDERKF and DDEABM on non-stiff problems
! ....   because it uses much more storage, has a much larger overhead,
! ....   and the low order formulas will not give high accuracies
! ....   efficiently.
!
! ....   The concept of stiffness cannot be described in a few words.
! ....   If you do not know the problem to be stiff, try either DDERKF
! ....   or DDEABM. Both of these codes will inform you of stiffness
! ....   when the cost of solving such problems becomes important.
