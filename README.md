The goal of this project is to produce a modern object-oriented Fortran implementation of the DDEABM Adams-Bashforth ODE solver.

The original Fortran 77 code is public domain, and was obtained from the [SLATEC library](http://www.netlib.org/slatec/src/). It has been extensively refactored.

*This is a work in progress.*
